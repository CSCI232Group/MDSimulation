I am currently modeling files after the examples given by the book's website and should be uploading a working copy by noon tomorrow.


Where is everyone else at? What are the ideas going around?
1. Should we all submit a working copy and then select the best? I think it is too late for (to much) group collaboration.
2. How are we feeling about modeling after the examples given by the book? Any objections or concerns on it?
3. How do you guys feel about Github/ would you mind doing more group projects for CS232 in this group folder?
